# 🗞 Is The Media Covering This?
***A Web App companion to the [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/aretheycovering) of the same name***

This started after spinning up a little API that searches for news articles for the Twitter bot I was making. I found that the bot could really only reply with how many articles were found, and that the article data itself couldn't be incorporated. Naturally I thought that I ought to make a web app that has similar functionality to the bot, but can also display some of the article details. At the same time I had been itching to find an excuse to play around with Chakra UI, and so this page was born. Below you'll find more details. Thanks for stopping by!
